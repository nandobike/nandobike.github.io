It was a good read, many interesting parts. I loved some characters such as Conseil. Although we never knew what happened to Captain Nemo or why he left 'civilization'.<br/>I would have given almost 5 stars but... the description of fishes used up to I think half of the book; almost all of it was irrelevant for the plot, it made many parts so tiring to read!
