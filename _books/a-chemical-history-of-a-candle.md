This is a great small book containing 6 lectures. Each chapter contains all his talk and some descriptions of the experiments he did.  He conduces audience in a clear line to thought to demonstrate the goal of the lesson. All experiments are so elegant!<br/>I just can't believe it is 150 years old...
