It is a good an interesting read. [a:Bill Bryson|7|Bill Bryson|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1189096502p2/7.jpg] did a great research work. However, the history is not 'short' at all. Too many facts were given which made the lecture dull at times. Also, the use of <s>retarded</s> imperial units made many parts awkward.
