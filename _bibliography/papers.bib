	abstract = {Structural characterization of porous carbon materials is critical for the evaluation of their synthesis procedures and performance. Throughout the last decades, many methods have been employed to determine porosity properties from gas adsorption such as surface area, pore size distribution ({PSD}) and real density. However, gas adsorption models use 1D structures of carbon nanopores, although adsorption and separation properties of nanoporous carbons are governed by 3D pore parameters. Estimating the 3D nanostructure of nanoporous carbons using gas adsorption would accelerate progress in research and implementation of nanoporous carbons. We report here a promising 3D pore nanostructural characterization from gas adsorption. Using atomistic simulations, we have generated a database of realistic 3D porous carbon structures spanning a wide range of pore sizes and geometries. After calculating their gas adsorption isotherms, we employed a numerical procedure to find the relative contribution for each of the structures to the adsorption isotherm of a nanoporous carbon sample. These contributions allowed us to estimate the surface area and pore size distribution of carbon materials; moreover (and perhaps more importantly!), we will show that the plausible 3D pore structures correlate very well with the local carbon structure as experimentally determined by high-resolution {TEM} observations and can successfully predict adsorption of different molecules. This is a powerful procedure that can be extended to other materials, and with enough computer power, to larger pore sizes.},

	doi = {10.1038/s41560-025-01783-z},
	abstract = {Storage and transportation of methane ({CH}4) remains challenging as it cannot be liquefied at ambient temperature and instead must be stored as compressed gas at high pressures (approximately 25 {MPa}). Alternatively, it can be stored within nanoporous materials at moderate pressures (for example, 3.5 {MPa}) but this ‘adsorbed natural gas’ approach can suffer from substantial desorption with only minor temperature increases. Both methods therefore necessitate additional safety measures. Here we report graphene-coated porous carbon materials that can be charged with {CH}4 at high pressure and retain it at ambient pressure and temperature (below 318 K), thereby enhancing storage safety. Our data suggest that graphene serves as a thermally controllable lock that obstructs or activates pores to trap or release {CH}4, enabling a pressure-equivalent loading of 19.9 {MPa} at 298 K, and release upon heating to 473 K. The resulting reversible {CH}4 volumetric capacity reaches 142 v/v, exceeding that of various adsorbed natural gas materials at 3.5 {MPa} and 298 K when considering container space utilization.},

	abstract = {The efficient separation of hydrogen from methane and light hydrocarbons for clean energy applications remains a technical challenge in membrane science. To address this issue, we prepared a graphene-wrapped {MFI} (G-{MFI}) molecular-sieving membrane for the ultrafast separation of hydrogen from methane at a permeability reaching 5.8 × 106 barrers at a single gas selectivity of 245 and a mixed gas selectivity of 50. Our results set an upper bound for hydrogen separation. Efficient molecular sieving comes from the subnanoscale interfacial space between graphene and zeolite crystal faces according to molecular dynamic simulations. The hierarchical pore structure of the G-{MFI} membrane enabled rapid permeability, indicating a promising route for the ultrafast separation of hydrogen/methane and carbon dioxide/methane in view of energy-efficient industrial gas separation.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
