	abstract = {Structural characterization of porous carbon materials is critical for the evaluation of their synthesis procedures and performance. Throughout the last decades, many methods have been employed to determine porosity properties from gas adsorption such as surface area, pore size distribution ({PSD}) and real density. However, gas adsorption models use 1D structures of carbon nanopores, although adsorption and separation properties of nanoporous carbons are governed by 3D pore parameters. Estimating the 3D nanostructure of nanoporous carbons using gas adsorption would accelerate progress in research and implementation of nanoporous carbons. We report here a promising 3D pore nanostructural characterization from gas adsorption. Using atomistic simulations, we have generated a database of realistic 3D porous carbon structures spanning a wide range of pore sizes and geometries. After calculating their gas adsorption isotherms, we employed a numerical procedure to find the relative contribution for each of the structures to the adsorption isotherm of a nanoporous carbon sample. These contributions allowed us to estimate the surface area and pore size distribution of carbon materials; moreover (and perhaps more importantly!), we will show that the plausible 3D pore structures correlate very well with the local carbon structure as experimentally determined by high-resolution {TEM} observations and can successfully predict adsorption of different molecules. This is a powerful procedure that can be extended to other materials, and with enough computer power, to larger pore sizes.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
