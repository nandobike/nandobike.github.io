I'm the Global Labs Manager at [Morgan Advanced Materials](https://www.morganadvancedmaterials.com), overseeing all testing labs for our Performance Carbon division. I get to design cutting-edge equipment and push our characterization techniques to their absolute limits. Honestly, I started as a materials scientist but discovered I don't have the patience to synthesize materials over and over—I'd rather figure out clever ways to test them and squeeze every insight from the data.

My path from Chile to Japan to the US gave me a PhD in carbon reactions and a deep love for adsorption science. There's something satisfying about understanding how molecules behave on carbon surfaces at the nanoscale, and that curiosity still drives a lot of what I do today, even if I'm now more focused on building the tools than running endless experiments myself.

I'm also pretty obsessed with data analysis, cybersecurity, and networking. I spend a lot of time learning these skills and applying them at work—whether it's securing our lab systems or finding patterns in test data that others might miss. My home lab is where I tinker with new tech, 3D printing projects, and whatever catches my interest that week.

Outside work, I'm all about doing sports, not watching them. Skiing, cycling, tennis, hiking—if it's outdoors and gets me moving, I'm in. I also love woodworking and building things with my hands, which probably explains why I enjoy designing lab equipment so much. It's all about solving problems and making things work better.
