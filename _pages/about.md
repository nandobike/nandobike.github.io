I'm the Global Labs Manager at [Morgan Advanced Materials](https://www.morganadvancedmaterials.com), running testing labs for our Performance Carbon division. I design cutting-edge equipment and push our capabilities to the limit. Started as a materials scientist but quickly realized I lack the patience for endless synthesis—I'd rather build smarter tests and mine the data for insights.

My PhD journey from Chile through Japan to the US got me hooked on carbon reactions and adsorption science. How molecules behave on carbon surfaces at the nanoscale still fascinates me—I just prefer building the tools over babysitting experiments.

I'm obsessed with data analysis, cybersecurity, and networks. I apply these skills at work constantly—securing lab systems, uncovering hidden patterns in data. My home lab is my playground for new tech, 3D printing, and whatever sparks my curiosity.

I do sports, don't watch them. Skiing, cycling, tennis, hiking—anything outdoors works. I also love woodworking and building things, which explains my passion for designing lab equipment. It's all about solving problems and making things work brilliantly.
